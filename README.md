Introduction to javacsript.

I used a code from Sm√°ri and played around with different effects.

I used VSCode to cedit the code. The biggest challenge was to understand what the code does and where to implement changes. I enjoyed this assignment and learned a bit about javascript. I found it challenging but having a template code to work with was very helpful.
